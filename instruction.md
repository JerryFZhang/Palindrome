# Audition Project
## Objective
Create a simple application that:
- Exposes a simple REST API that allows users to:
- Allows users to submit/post messages
- Lists received messages
- Retrieves a specific message on demand, and determines if it is a palindrome.
- Allows users to delete specific messages
- Provides a simple UI to interact with the service:
- Shows the list of messages posted by the users
- Allows to post new messages
- Allows to select a given message to see extra details
- **(Extra points)** The application is deployed to a Cloud Provider (AWS is preferred)
- A Compute instance is provisioned programmatically
- Application can be reached via public DNS record
- **(Extra points)** Functional and System Tests
- **(Extra points)** Application is deployed in a container

## Additional Info / Restrictions
- Extra information can be requested by e-mail.
- Code should have a permissive license.
- Any programming language can be used.
- Use of proprietary tools/libraries is discouraged.

## Submission
Code should be committed to a public GitHub/Bitbucket repository:
- The repo includes service, UI, and provisioning code.
- README.md Includes:
- Brief description of the implementation architecture.
- Sequence diagram of the use cases' interactions.
- How to: build, deploy and access the app.
- REST API documentation.
A URI to the app should be provided.

Be prepared to discuss the architectural design and implementation details of your project.
