- **(Done)** Shows the list of messages posted by the users
- **(Done)** Allows to post new messages
- **(Done)** Allows to select a given message to see extra details
- **(Done)** The application is deployed to a Cloud Provider (AWS is preferred)
- **(Done)** A Compute instance is provisioned programmatically
- **(Done)** Application can be reached via public DNS record
- <del>**(Extra points)** Functional and System Tests</del>
- <del>**(Extra points)** Application is deployed in a container</del>

## Additional Info / Restrictions
- Extra information can be requested by e-mail.
- Code should have a permissive license.
- Any programming language can be used.
- Use of proprietary tools/libraries is discouraged.

## Submission
Code should be committed to a public GitHub/Bitbucket repository:
- **(Done)** The repo includes service, UI, and provisioning code.
- README.md Includes:
- **(Done)** Brief description of the implementation architecture.
- **(Done)** Sequence diagram of the use cases' interactions.
- **(Done)** How to: build, deploy and access the app.
- **(Done)** REST API documentation.
- **(Done)** A URI to the app should be provided.
